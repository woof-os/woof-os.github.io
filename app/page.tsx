        <h1>Woof OS</h1>
        <p>
          Woof OS is a simple respin of Arch Linux with a focus on simplicity
          and speed. The main focus was to recreate my personal setup (only
          applies to the Qtile edition) in a way that is easy for install and
          get up and running quickly. The distro is designed to be a daily
          driver for those who want a system close to Arch Linux without the
          hassle of setting up everything from scratch.
        </p>
        <p>
          The configuration files and any packages outside the Arch Linux
          repositories used in Woof OS are also available to install through our
          pacman repository. You can find the repository information on the{" "}

            pacman

          page.
